Feature: CLI notebook clone
  As a learner, I want to clone my notebook to a local Git checkout using the Donut CLI so I
  can read and edit it with ordinary tools.

  Background:
    Given the backend is serving the CLI and install script
    And I install the CLI from localhost without affecting my system
    And I am logged in as an existing user
    And I have a notebook "CLI Clone Notebook"
    And I have a note "Overview" under notebook "CLI Clone Notebook" with content:
      """
      ---
      type: Note
      ---
      """
    And the notebook "CLI Clone Notebook" has readme content "Notebook landing"
    And the notebook "CLI Clone Notebook" has a readme-only folder "Recipes" with readme "Folder landing"
    And I have a note "Pasta" under notebook "CLI Clone Notebook" in folder "Recipes" with content:
      """
      ---
      type: Note
      author: Chef Boyardee
      ---
      Boil water
      """
    And the notebook "CLI Clone Notebook"'s Git binding reflects its current content
    And I have a valid Donut Access Token with label "E2E CLI Clone Token"

  Scenario: Cloning an owned notebook produces a clean canonical Git checkout
    When I clone the notebook "CLI Clone Notebook" into a temporary destination using the installed CLI
    Then the cloned checkout is a clean single-commit checkout on branch "main"
    And the cloned checkout contains exactly:
      | README.md         |
      | Overview.md       |
      | Recipes/README.md |
      | Recipes/Pasta.md  |
    And I should see "Publishing currently accepts one new commit directly on the accepted main" in the non-interactive output
    When I open the notebook "CLI Clone Notebook" from the notebook catalog
    Then the notebook readme body includes "Notebook landing"

  Scenario: Publishing a committed note edit updates the same Donut note
    When I clone the notebook "CLI Clone Notebook" into a temporary destination using the installed CLI
    And I commit the following edit to "Recipes/Pasta.md" in the cloned checkout:
      """
      ---
      type: Note
      author: Chef Boyardee
      ---
      Simmer until al dente
      """
    And I publish the cloned checkout using the installed CLI
    Then the installed CLI reports the committed edit as the accepted head
    And note "Pasta" should have content "Simmer until al dente"
