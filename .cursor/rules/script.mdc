# Shell Script Development

## Script Location

- Place scripts in the `scripts/` directory
- Use descriptive names with `.sh` extension
- Make scripts executable: `chmod +x scripts/script_name.sh`

## Unit Testing

### Test Framework

- Use **Bach** testing framework for shell script unit tests
- Bach is located at `scripts/test/vendor/bach.sh`
- Bach requires Bash 4.3+ (available in nix environment)

### Test File Structure

- Test files should be in `scripts/test/` directory
- Use `.test` extension (e.g., `scripts/test/run.sh.test`)
- Test files must be executable

### Writing Tests

1. Source Bach framework:
   ```bash
   source "$(dirname "$0")/vendor/bach.sh"
   ```

2. Create test functions with `test-` prefix:
   ```bash
   test-my-feature() {
       # Test implementation
   }
   ```

3. Create assertion functions with `-assert` suffix:
   ```bash
   test-my-feature-assert() {
       @out "expected output"
   }
   ```

4. Bach uses dry-run testing - it compares commands executed in test functions with expected commands in assert functions

### Running Tests

- Run all tests: `bash scripts/test/run_all_script_tests.sh`
- Run individual test: `bash scripts/test/script_name.test`
- In nix environment: `./scripts/run.sh bash scripts/test/run_all_script_tests.sh`

### Test Requirements

- All scripts in `scripts/` should have corresponding tests in `scripts/test/`
- Tests are automatically discovered and run in CI
- Tests must pass before merging
