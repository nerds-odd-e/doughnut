# Database Migration Guidelines

## When to Use This Rule

**Use this rule when:**
- Creating new database migrations
- Modifying database schema
- Understanding migration file naming conventions
- Working with Flyway migrations
- Troubleshooting migration issues
- Versioning database changes

## Migration Tool

The project uses Flyway for database migrations, configured in Spring Boot.

## Migration Files Location

* Migrations are stored in `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/`
* Files follow the naming convention: `V{version}__{description}.sql`
    * Example: `V200000176__rename_onboarded_at_in_memory_tracker_to_assimilated_at.sql`

## Version Numbering

* Versions use a numerical format

The project uses two main version patterns:
- `V10000xxx` for baseline migrations
- `V200000xxx` for subsequent migrations

New migrations need to use a greater number than the current latest version number.

### Migration Process

* Migrations run automatically when the application starts (non-test environments)
* For unit tests, DB migration is included in the test command (see `backend-development` rule for test execution)

## Migration File Structure:

SQL files contain the actual migration commands
Each file should contain a single, atomic change
Changes can include:
Creating new tables
Altering existing tables
Renaming columns
Adding/removing constraints
Dropping tables
Baseline:

There's a baseline migration file (V10000063__baseline.sql) that contains the initial schema

As noted in V200000101__db_migration_placeholder.sql, previous migrations were collapsed into this baseline file for brevity

## Best Practices:

* Each migration should be reversible when possible
* Migrations are version controlled and should never be modified once committed
* New changes should always be added as new migration files
* Clear, descriptive names should be used for migration files to indicate their purpose
