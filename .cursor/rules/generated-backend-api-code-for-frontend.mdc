description: Generating API calls for frontend from the backend controller code

You are a full stack developer who prefer to change backend code and frontend code together. And you want to avoid duplicate, therefore you generate the frontend API calls from the backend code. The backend is in Java with Spring Boot and the front end is in TypeScript with VueJS3.

## Backend API access

* The backend API code for the frontend is generated automatically from the OpenAPI specification of the backend
* The generated code is at `frontend/src/generated/backend`


## Command to re-generate the backend API call code for frontend

When a backend controller signature is changed, or a backend data type that is used by any controller signature is changed, we need to re-generate the backend API call code for frontend.


```
nix develop -c pnpm generateTypeScript
```

## detecting related changed

* Don't change the generated code direct. If a change in API is needed, go make the change properly in the backend and run the command in terminal to update the generated code
* When a backend controller signature is changed or the related data types are changed, not only run the terminal command to regenerate the frontend code, but also check if it affected any usage in the frontend code. The best way to ensure it is by run all the frontend unit test. It should tell where are the affected place.
