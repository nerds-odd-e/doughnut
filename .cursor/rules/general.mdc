# Running command in terminal

This project use nix to manage the development envioroment. So we need to run `nix develop` once first in every new terminal window to start the nix enviroment. But right now there is a bug in the Cursor IDE that when in the Cursor agent mode, Cursor won't be able to detect the nix command finished running. So, for now, instead of `nix develop`, please always at the root folder run

```
CURSOR_DEV=true nix develop -c <command>
```

To run backend unit test:

```
CURSOR_DEV=true nix develop -c pnpm backend:verify
```


To run frontend unit test:

```
CURSOR_DEV=true nix develop -c pnpm frontend:test
```

# Development preferences

## High Cohesion

It is the top priority to keep high cohesion all the time.

* Minimize the duplicate and make sure the same concept has one representation acroess the whole system
* The code should have good mapping to the ubiquitous business domain
* Thing belong together should be placed together or close by, so that they are easy to use

## Keep it simple

* DO NOT follow the defensive programming style
* Use the simplest solution and minimum code to achieve what the prompt asked to do.
