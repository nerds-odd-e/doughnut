How to Play (Each Round)
	1.	Organizer starts a round.
	2.	Each player chooses:
        •	Normal → safer, no extra damage.
        •	Super → faster, but +1 damage.
	3.	Dice are rolled (1–6).
        •	If you chose Normal:
            •	Even roll (2, 4, 6) → base step = 2
            •	Odd roll (1, 3, 5) → base step = 1
        •	If you chose Super:
            •	Base step = the dice number (1–6)
            •	Damage increases by 1
	4.	Final movement = base step – current damage (minimum 0).
	5.	Move your car forward by the final movement.

⸻

Winning
	•	The first player to reach or pass the finish line wins.
	•	Once a winner is declared, the game ends.

⸻

Example Moves
	•	Normal, 0 damage, roll 2 → base step 2 – 0 = 2 steps
	•	Normal, 1 damage, roll 3 → base step 1 – 1 = 0 steps
	•	Super, 0 damage, roll 4 → base step 4 – 1 = 3 steps (damage becomes 1)
	•	Super, 1 damage, roll 2 → base step 2 – 2 = 0 steps (damage becomes 2)

⸻

✅ Simple formula: Final movement = base step – damage (never negative).
✅ Works with 3 to 100 players.
✅ Fun to watch on the big screen, fun to play on your phone.
