How to Play (Each Round)
	1.	Organizer starts a round.
	2.	Each player chooses:
        â€¢	Normal â†’ safer, no extra damage.
        â€¢	Super â†’ faster, but +1 damage.
	3.	Dice are rolled (1â€“6).
        â€¢	If you chose Normal:
            â€¢	Even roll (2, 4, 6) â†’ base step = 2
            â€¢	Odd roll (1, 3, 5) â†’ base step = 1
        â€¢	If you chose Super:
            â€¢	Base step = the dice number (1â€“6)
            â€¢	Damage increases by 1
	4.	Final movement = base step â€“ current damage (minimum 0).
	5.	Move your car forward by the final movement.
