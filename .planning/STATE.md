# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-08-05)

**Core value:** Healthy mainline for learning and knowledge work — reviewed note stays primary during accidental-match results.
**Current focus:** Phase 7 plans complete — ready for verification; then Phase 8

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 12 (Compact result + Resolve dialog shell)
Plan: 2/2 complete
Status: ready_for_verification — 07-01 + 07-02 done
Last activity: 2026-08-05 — Completed 07-02 E2E resolve dialog rewrite

Progress: [██████████] 100% (phase plans)

## Performance Metrics

Preserved in `MILESTONES.md` for v1.0–v1.1. v1.2 metrics start after first plan completion.

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 07 | 2/2 | 8min | 4min |

**Per-Plan Metrics:**

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 07 P01 | 6min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 07 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Resolve via optional dialog (not stacked NoteShows) — PROJECT.md / v1.2
- Overlap from dialog skips try-again / credit reclaim — PROJECT.md / v1.2
- AMR-07 (readonly gating) lives with first mutating action (Phase 9 Build a link)
- Phase 10 is Structure-only (overlap alias append util) immediately before Phase 11
- SEED-001 and AMR-10..13 deferred to v2 — not on this roadmap
- [Phase 7]: Slot AccidentalMatchResolveDialog without closer — Modal dismiss covers AMR-03
- [Phase 7]: Keep MatchedNoteLinkOffer.vue unused until Phase 9 Build a link
- [Phase 7]: Keep link page-object helpers callable for Phase 9; only tag Gherkin scenarios @wip
- [Phase 7]: Prefer page-object behavior change over Gherkin step text changes

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 11: must not conflate dialog overlap declare with `AnswerOutcome.OVERLAP` try-again / SRS reclaim (ADR 0003)
- Phase 12: answer remount/session on title navigate may need plan-time research

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| seed | SEED-001 MCQ/fuzzy/`Notebook:Title` | dormant | v1.2 scoping |
| polish | AMR-10..13 resolve polish | v2 | v1.2 scoping |

**Parked:** [SEED-001](./seeds/SEED-001-mcq-fuzzy-notebook-title-spelling-match.md)
