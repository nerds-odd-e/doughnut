# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-21)

**Core value:** When a long-running frontend action blocks the UI, the user can cancel it and remain in a coherent, usable state without unintended follow-up behavior.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Cancel Refinement Layout Generation

## Current Position

Phase: 2 — Cancel Refinement Layout Generation
Plan: Not started
Status: Research complete — ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-21 — Phase 02 research complete (cancel layout generation adoption)

Progress: Phase 1 done; Phase 2 researching/planning

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Cancellation is opt-in and client-side first; browser abort does not promise server cancellation
- Initialization: Only read-only AI generation is cancelable in v1; final extracted-note creation remains noncancelable
- Initialization: Shared code owns generic mechanics; each caller owns only its specialized post-cancel state
- [Phase 01]: Cancelable calls require literal blockUi and cancelable opt-in while default calls retain Promise<T>. — Keeps Phase 1 dormant and preserves all existing caller types.
- [Phase 01]: Accepted exact-state removal is the cancellation linearization point. — Makes cancellation identity-bound, idempotent, prompt, and unable to retarget concurrent work.
- [Phase 01]: Project message, identity, and cancel action directly from the same selected blocker. — Prevents hidden cancellation capability from leaking into the visible modal.
- [Phase 01]: A keyed child captures its original cancellation action. — Prevents stale detached controls from adopting a revealed replacement blocker's callback.
- [Phase 01]: Fix LoadingModal overflow only on Overlay centered CSS (safe center + overflow-y auto); leave LoadingModal and cancellation semantics untouched.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Browser abort must be passed into each generated API call through its supported request signal
- Mutation call sites must not expose Cancel until a safe backend contract exists

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Server cooperation | Stop server-side AI work after client cancellation | Deferred | Initialization |
| Mutation safety | Reconcile or make transactional cancellation idempotent | Deferred | Initialization |
