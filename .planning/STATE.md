# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-22)

**Core value:** From Notebook Settings → Health, a user can run lint and see actionable health findings — with optional bulk removal of empty folders when auto-fix is enabled.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Readme-only folder findings (next)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 7 (Readme-only folder findings) — ready
Plan: (next milestone phase)
Status: Phase 2 complete (EmptyFolderHealthRule + authorized lint API)
Last activity: 2026-07-22 — Completed 02-02: authorized notebook health lint endpoint

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 29% (2/7 phases)

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table and Phase 1 CONTEXT.

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Report before mutate; Structure only for immediate next Behavior
- Empty folders vs readme-only (`readmeContent`) are separate finding types
- Dead links report-only; only fix is bulk purge of fully empty folders (not dissolve)
- Per-user defaults; Health tab only (no `/health` route or dialog)
- Phase 1: DTO classes with Lombok getters/setters; `HealthSeverity` lowercase constants
- Phase 1: Group-level `autoFixable` only (no item-level)
- Phase 1: `HealthRuleRunner` uses `List.copyOf`; zero rule beans; public `NotebookHealthService.lint`
- Phase 2: Empty-folder label is bare folder name (D-04 v1)
- Phase 2: Blank readme = null or String.isBlank()
- Phase 2: Always emit empty_folders group even when items empty
- Phase 2: Dedicated NotebookHealthController (not NotebookController) for cohesion and 250-line discipline
- Phase 2: Owner write auth only via assertAuthorization (never assertReadAuthorization)
- Phase 2: No request DTO / fix options for Phase 2 lint (D-09)
