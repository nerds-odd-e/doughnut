# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-22)

**Core value:** From Notebook Settings → Health, a user can run lint and see actionable health findings — with optional bulk removal of empty folders when auto-fix is enabled.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Dead-link findings complete; Phase 5 next (no auto-transition)

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 7 (Dead-link findings) — complete
Plan: 04-02 done (both Phase 4 plans complete)
Status: Phase 4 complete — dead_wiki_links report-only via NotebookHealthService.lint
Last activity: 2026-07-22 — DeadWikiLinkHealthRule + DLNK-01/02/03 tests green
Resume file: None

Progress: [██████████] 100% plans for phases 1–4 (4/7 milestone phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 7

| 3. Readme-only folder findings | 1/1 | 1 | 6 min |
| 4. Dead-link findings | 2/2 | 2 | 5.5 min |

**Per-Plan Metrics:**

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table and Phase 1 CONTEXT.

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Report before mutate; Structure only for immediate next Behavior
- Empty folders vs readme-only (`readmeContent`) are separate finding types
- Dead links report-only; only fix is bulk purge of fully empty folders (not dissolve)
- Per-user defaults; Health tab only (no `/health` route or dialog)
- Phase 1: DTO classes with Lombok getters/setters; `HealthSeverity` lowercase constants
- Phase 1: Group-level `autoFixable` only (no item-level)
- Phase 1: `HealthRuleRunner` uses `List.copyOf`; zero rule beans; public `NotebookHealthService.lint`
- Phase 2: Empty-folder label is bare folder name (D-04 v1)
- Phase 2: Blank readme = null or String.isBlank()
- Phase 2: Always emit empty_folders group even when items empty
- Phase 2: Dedicated NotebookHealthController (not NotebookController) for cohesion and 250-line discipline
- Phase 2: Owner write auth only via assertAuthorization (never assertReadAuthorization)
- Phase 2: No request DTO / fix options for Phase 2 lint (D-09)
- Phase 3: Own non-blank readme only — no ancestor inheritance (D-02)
- Phase 3: readme_only_folders autoFixable=false (D-07)
- Phase 3: Shared FolderSubtreeLiveNotes.noteEmptyFolderItems for complementary gates (D-10)
- Phase 4: Dead = viewer-readable WikiLinkResolver unresolved; extract via wikiLinkInnersInOccurrenceOrder; live sources only; distinct tokens; nest by note; autoFixable=false; always emit (D-01..D-13)
- HealthRunContext requires User viewer; unresolvedWikiLinkTokens uses viewer-readable resolveToken only
- DeadWikiLinkHealthRule: children-by-note nesting; top items empty; report-only
