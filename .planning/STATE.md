# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-08-05)

**Core value:** Healthy mainline for learning and knowledge work — reviewed note stays primary during accidental-match results.
**Current focus:** Phase 9 complete (AMR-06/AMR-07) — next Phase 10 Structure

## Current Position

Phase: 10 of 12 (Overlap alias append util) — ready
Plan: Phase 10 next (Structure)
Status: Phase 9 complete — Vitest + E2E Build a link green without @wip
Last activity: 2026-08-05 — Completed 09-02 Build a link E2E

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50% (3/6 v1.2 phases; 6/6 plans executed across phases 7–9)

## Performance Metrics

Preserved in `MILESTONES.md` for v1.0–v1.1. v1.2 metrics start after first plan completion.

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 07 | 2/2 | 8min | 4min |
| 08 | 2/2 | 6min | 3min |
| 09 | 2/2 | 7min | 3.5min |

**Per-Plan Metrics:**

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 07 P01 | 6min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 07 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 08 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 08 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 09 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 09 P02 | 3min | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Resolve via optional dialog (not stacked NoteShows) — PROJECT.md / v1.2
- Overlap from dialog skips try-again / credit reclaim — PROJECT.md / v1.2
- AMR-07 (readonly gating) lives with first mutating action (Phase 9 Build a link)
- Phase 10 is Structure-only (overlap alias append util) immediately before Phase 11
- SEED-001 and AMR-10..13 deferred to v2 — not on this roadmap
- [Phase 7]: Slot AccidentalMatchResolveDialog without closer — Modal dismiss covers AMR-03
- [Phase 7]: Keep MatchedNoteLinkOffer.vue unused until Phase 9 Build a link
- [Phase 7]: Keep link page-object helpers callable for Phase 9; only tag Gherkin scenarios @wip
- [Phase 7]: Prefer page-object behavior change over Gherkin step text changes
- [Phase 8]: Keep NoteTopology[]; hydrate via getNoteRealmRefAndLoadWhenNeeded (D-01, D-02)
- [Phase 8]: AccidentalMatchResolveRow — NoteTitleWithLink above BreadcrumbWithCircle (D-03..D-06)
- [Phase 8]: No AMR-05 reopen this phase; hydrate on dialog mount; Vitest then E2E (D-07..D-11)
- [Phase 8]: Assert router-link to under RenderingHelper stub for title navigation
- [Phase 8]: Distinct notebook names via accidentalMatchWithTwoMatchedNotes notebookNames option
- [Phase 08]: Same-notebook English practice path assert is enough for E2E AMR-04 (D-11)
- [Phase 08]: Assert visible title anchor without click-through; AMR-05 reopen deferred to Phase 12
- [Phase 9]: Single-Modal step swap to MatchedNoteLinkOffer — never nest PopButton (D-01)
- [Phase 9]: Step state in AccidentalMatchResolveDialog; pass reviewedNoteId (D-02)
- [Phase 9]: Per-row Build a link; reuse offer; closeDialog → return to list (D-03..D-05)
- [Phase 9]: Hide Build a link when readonly or realms unloaded (D-06, D-07)
- [Phase 9]: Vitest Wave 1 then E2E untag @wip Wave 2 (D-08, D-09)
- [Phase 9]: Single-Modal step swap hosts MatchedNoteLinkOffer; closeDialog returns to list
- [Phase 9]: canOfferBuildLink hides Build a link when readonly or realms unloaded
- [Phase 9]: Page-object-only Resolve → Build a link path; Gherkin unchanged (D-09)
- [Phase 9]: Stay-on-result asserts alert + Resolve CTA + dialog list (D-04); no matched-notes-section

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 11: must not conflate dialog overlap declare with `AnswerOutcome.OVERLAP` try-again / SRS reclaim (ADR 0003)
- Phase 12: answer remount/session on title navigate may need plan-time research
