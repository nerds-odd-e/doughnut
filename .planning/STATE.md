# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-08-05)

**Core value:** Healthy mainline for learning and knowledge work — reviewed note stays primary during accidental-match results.
**Current focus:** Phase 9 UI-SPEC draft complete — ready for ui-checker / plan

## Current Position

Phase: 9 of 12 (Build a link from resolve dialog) — UI-SPEC draft; plans TBD
Plan: none yet
Status: Phase 9 09-UI-SPEC.md written — AMR-06/AMR-07 design contract ready for checker
Last activity: 2026-08-05 — Phase 9 UI design contract (Build a link step + gates)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33% (2/6 v1.2 phases; 4 plans executed across phases 7–8)

## Performance Metrics

Preserved in `MILESTONES.md` for v1.0–v1.1. v1.2 metrics start after first plan completion.

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 07 | 2/2 | 8min | 4min |
| 08 | 2/2 | 6min | 3min |

**Per-Plan Metrics:**

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 07 P01 | 6min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 07 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 08 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 08 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Resolve via optional dialog (not stacked NoteShows) — PROJECT.md / v1.2
- Overlap from dialog skips try-again / credit reclaim — PROJECT.md / v1.2
- AMR-07 (readonly gating) lives with first mutating action (Phase 9 Build a link)
- Phase 10 is Structure-only (overlap alias append util) immediately before Phase 11
- SEED-001 and AMR-10..13 deferred to v2 — not on this roadmap
- [Phase 7]: Slot AccidentalMatchResolveDialog without closer — Modal dismiss covers AMR-03
- [Phase 7]: Keep MatchedNoteLinkOffer.vue unused until Phase 9 Build a link
- [Phase 7]: Keep link page-object helpers callable for Phase 9; only tag Gherkin scenarios @wip
- [Phase 7]: Prefer page-object behavior change over Gherkin step text changes
- [Phase 8]: Keep NoteTopology[]; hydrate via getNoteRealmRefAndLoadWhenNeeded (D-01, D-02)
- [Phase 8]: AccidentalMatchResolveRow — NoteTitleWithLink above BreadcrumbWithCircle (D-03..D-06)
- [Phase 8]: No AMR-05 reopen this phase; hydrate on dialog mount; Vitest then E2E (D-07..D-11)
- [Phase 8]: Assert router-link to under RenderingHelper stub for title navigation
- [Phase 8]: Distinct notebook names via accidentalMatchWithTwoMatchedNotes notebookNames option
- [Phase 08]: Same-notebook English practice path assert is enough for E2E AMR-04 (D-11)
- [Phase 08]: Assert visible title anchor without click-through; AMR-05 reopen deferred to Phase 12

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 11: must not conflate dialog overlap declare with `AnswerOutcome.OVERLAP` try-again / SRS reclaim (ADR 0003)
- Phase 12: answer remount/session on title navigate may need plan-time research

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| seed | SEED-001 MCQ/fuzzy/`Notebook:Title` | dormant | v1.2 scoping |
| polish | AMR-10..13 resolve polish | v2 | v1.2 scoping |

**Parked:** [SEED-001](./seeds/SEED-001-mcq-fuzzy-notebook-title-spelling-match.md)
