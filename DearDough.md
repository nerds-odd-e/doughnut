## ODF-030 — One-off profile capture treated as durable runner plumbing

Former local code: DD-013.

A tagged publication-profile capture drove a durable `pnpm cy:run` change to
forward Cypress `--expose`/`--config`, including runner tests, then a closing
slice reverted that forwarding because it served measurement rather than the
kept product change.

### Occurrences

- Execution: SEED-018 story 3 / quick/106-publish-large-notebooks-under-one-minute / 78c24f31bb
  - Tool: Cursor
  - Model: Cursor Grok 4.6
  - Open Dough release: 0.3.12
  - Evidence: slice 2 commit `6162492745` added forwarding in
    `scripts/e2e-runner.mjs` and `scripts/e2e-runner.test.mjs`; close commit
    `3613029688` restored those files to `78c24f31bb`; PLAN closing decision
    (2026-09-12) says the plumbing served measurement, not the kept flush change.
  - Observed effect: slice 2 included runner work beyond the property-index
    flush change; slice 4 existed only to undo that forwarding.
  - Inference: isolated tagged captures can use a documented one-off Cypress
    invocation or known baseline waits without changing the owned runner.

## ODF-034 — CI observer started for a feature branch that this project's workflow never triggers on

Former local code: DD-017.

`dough-execute-plan`'s CI-observation setup verified only that the workflow
file and name existed and that the notification host bridge was ready; it did
not check the workflow's actual trigger condition. This project's `ci.yml`
triggers only on `push: branches: [main]`, with no `pull_request:` trigger
anywhere, so pushing to an execution branch can never produce a CI run for
the observer to see, regardless of how long it watches.

### Occurrences

- Execution: SEED-018 story 3 / quick/108-publish-notebook-edits-faster / a6fcddacad
  - Tool: Claude Code
  - Model: claude-sonnet-5
  - Open Dough release: 0.3.13
  - Evidence: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` line 6-9 (`on: push: branches:
    [main]`); `gh run list --repo nerds-odd-e/doughnut --json headBranch,...`
    shows recent runs only for `headBranch: "main"`, none for
    `quick/108-publish-notebook-edits-faster` despite two pushes to it.
  - Observed effect: the CI observer ran for the full execution and was
    stopped at completion reporting `pendingCi: unobserved`, phrased (in the
    coordinator's own completion report) as CI merely not having finished
    yet, when in fact no CI run was ever going to happen on that branch.
  - Inference: the runtime-setup step "verify the branch has a
    push-triggered CI workflow" needs an actual trigger-condition check (e.g.
    inspecting the workflow's `on:` block for the target branch), not just
    confirming the workflow file/name resolve, or it will silently watch a
    branch that structurally cannot produce events.

- Execution: SEED-019 story 1 / quick/114-note-owned-memory-tracker-deletion / be43a2c1e5
  - Tool: Cursor
  - Model: GLM 5.2
  - Open Dough release: 0.3.15
  - Evidence: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` triggers only on `push:
    branches: [main]`; `gh run list --branch 114-note-owned-memory-tracker-deletion`
    returned no runs despite seven pushes to that branch; the CI observer
    (started during slice 1 delivery) ran for the full execution and was
    stopped at completion reporting `pendingCi: unobserved`.
  - Observed effect: the CI observer watched a branch that structurally
    cannot produce CI events for the entire execution; the runtime-setup
    probe verified only that the workflow file/name resolved and the host
    bridge was ready, so the gap was not caught at setup.
  - Inference: same as the original ODF-034 finding — the runtime-setup
    trigger-condition check is still absent; the recurrence confirms the
    anti-pattern persists across releases.

## ODF-035 — `EnterWorktree`'s default base ref and branch-name sanitization conflict with this project's worktree/branch convention

Former local code: DD-018.

The harness's built-in `EnterWorktree` tool, used to set up a planned-execution
worktree for an intended branch name containing `/` (this project's
`quick/<slug>` convention), does not treat that name as a literal branch name:
each `/`-segment is sanitized and a `worktree-` prefix is added, and its
default `baseRef: "fresh"` branches from `origin/<default-branch>` rather than
local `HEAD`, silently omitting a commit already made locally on the
originating branch before the worktree was created.

### Occurrences

- Execution: SEED-018 story 5 / quick/112-publish-additions-with-simpler-title-check / 691e7be961
  - Tool: Claude Code
  - Model: claude-sonnet-5
  - Open Dough release: 0.3.14
  - Evidence: `EnterWorktree(name: "quick/112-publish-additions-with-simpler-title-check")`
    returned branch `worktree-quick+112-publish-additions-with-simpler-title-check`
    checked out at `4b89109c99` (origin/main's tip), while local `main` was
    already one commit ahead at `aaabfcf552` (the backlog "Taken" transition
    commit made just before). The coordinator detected the mismatch via `git
    branch --show-current` / `git log --oneline`, called
    `ExitWorktree(action: "remove")`, then created
    `.worktrees/112-publish-additions-with-simpler-title-check` with plain
    `git worktree add -b quick/112-publish-additions-with-simpler-title-check
    aaabfcf552` under this project's own gitignored `.worktrees/` convention.
  - Observed effect: one full extra round-trip (create, inspect, remove)
    before the correctly named/based worktree existed; no lost work, since
    nothing had yet been written into the discarded worktree.
  - Inference: a coordinator following a project convention that both names
    execution branches literally and requires branching from a fresh
    local-only commit should create the worktree with plain `git worktree add`
    rather than `EnterWorktree`, whenever either constraint applies.

## ODF-042 — Coordinator pre-filtered grep results for a test-only representation slice, missing sites the later field-removal slice had to fix

Former local code: DD-037.

A test-only representation slice (replacing soon-to-be-removed field
references with owned observations) was delegated with a pre-filtered file
list: the coordinator classified each `getDeletedAt()` grep hit as a Note
or MemoryTracker assertion and delegated only the files with tracker
assertions. Two sites were missed — one file entirely omitted from the
delegation, and one remaining call in an included file — because the
classification was incomplete. The later slice that removed the field
caught both at compile time, but at the cost of that slice doing extra
test fixes outside its primary schema-removal scope.

### Occurrences

- Execution: SEED-019 story 1 / quick/114-note-owned-memory-tracker-deletion / be43a2c1e5
  - Tool: Cursor
  - Model: GLM 5.2
  - Open Dough release: 0.3.15
  - Evidence: slice 6 (test-only representation) delegation listed five
    files with tracker `deletedAt` assertions but omitted
    `NoteControllerDeleteReduceToSourceTests` (whose
    `relation.getDeletedAt()` / `reloaded.getDeletedAt()` calls were tracker
    assertions the coordinator marked "need to check"); slice 7 (field
    removal) commit `be43a2c1e5` fixed that file plus one remaining
    `retained.getDeletedAt()` call in
    `NotebookGitProposalFolderCreationControllerTest` that slice 6 missed.
  - Observed effect: slice 7's implementation agent fixed two extra test
    files at compile time; no extra coordinator round-trip, but the later
    slice carried representation work the earlier slice was meant to own.
  - Inference: for a test-only representation slice that replaces references
    to a field removed in a later slice, delegate all grep matches and let
    the implementation agent classify each (Note vs tracker), rather than
    the coordinator pre-filtering; the compile-time safety net catches
    misses, but shifting that work to the later slice blurs the slice's
    intended boundary.

## ODF-051 — Refactor subagent reported removing dead dependencies it did not actually remove

A post-change refactor subagent consolidated web note-move orchestration into
`NoteMoveService` and reported it had removed the now-unused
`noteMotionService`, `wikiLinkRewriteService`, and `wikiLinkRelocationRewrite`
fields/imports from `RelationController`. The coordinator's proof-acceptance
inspection of the actual `git diff` showed the three fields were still
declared and assigned but never referenced — the report was inaccurate. The
coordinator resumed the same refactor agent with the diff evidence to
actually remove the dead dependencies, then re-ran the affected suites.

### Occurrences
- Execution: plan 100 `cursor/100-receive-web-note-moves` (SEED-009 story 25)
  - Timestamp: 2026-09-15T13:52:00+08:00
  - Tool: Cursor
  - Model: glm-5.2-high
  - Open Dough release: unreleased
  - Evidence: slice 2 refactor return vs `git diff -- RelationController.java`
    on commit `febbd2d9bb`; resumed agent removed the fields, re-verified
    before `8d67cd6cff`.
  - Observed effect: the refactor report's "removed fields" claim did not
    match the diff; three dead dependencies survived the first refactor pass
    and were only removed after the coordinator caught the gap and resumed.
  - Inference: a refactor subagent's report text is not proof; coordinator
    proof acceptance must inspect the actual diff at the reported boundary,
    not trust the report's claimed edits. Dead-dependency removal after
    consolidation is exactly the kind of refactor claim that is cheap to
    verify against `git diff` and easy to misreport.
